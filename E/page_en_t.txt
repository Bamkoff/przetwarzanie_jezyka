First, a few words about myself.
I graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland.
I also graduated from PhD studies at this Faculty.
I have PhD degree in mathematics, specializing in computer science.
Currently I work at the Faculty at the position of Assisstant Professor.
I conduct scientific research and teach classes.
Materials for my classes are available in the "Teaching" section.In my scientific work I combine computer science with my other passion - linguistics (as a Polish native speaker I also speak English, Spanish, German and some Italian).
My main area of interest is computational linguistics.
This is further described in the section "Science".I am the developer of the Concordia project - a full text search library best suited for Computer-Aided Translation.

406-416, 2010 [pdf]scientific workIn my scientific work I conduct studies in computational linguistics, searching algorithms and some machine translation techniques.
I would be glad to start scientific projects or help anyone interested in the following subjects:Approximate searchingExample-based translationCorpora acquisitionSentence splittingText aligningSoftware engineeringApproximate searching - my main field of interest.
Its task is to find in the text not necessarily exact matches of input pattern.
The technique is applied whenever the searched resource might contain errors (e.g.
OCR corpora).Example Based Machine Translation - my former main field of interest, subject of my Master's Thesis.
EBMT is translation based on analogy principle.
Its idea can be explained as follows:Let the language fromAn example is a pair of sentences (in source and target language respectively) where the target sentence is a good translation of the source sentence.
A large set of examples is called a translation memory.
EBMT of the input sentence is done by the following steps:Find an example in the translation memory whose source sentence is most similar to the input sentence.Modify the example, so that its source sentence maximally resembles the input sentence.Return the modified target sentence as translation result.As you can see, some of the above steps are non-trivial.
What does it mean that to sentences are "similar", how to acquire translation memory and, most importantly, how to modify the example.
All of these problems are parts of EBMT.Parallel text corpora acquisition - auxiliary technique, acquired corpora can serve as translation memories for EBMT and for many other purposes (e.g.
statistical translation).
However, corpora acquisition is a very interesting task itself.
It consists in developing tools for automatic text extraction from documents acquired from the Internet or from any other source.Sentence splitting - or "Sensplitting".
Another auxiliary technique which, contrary to what you might think, is not trivial.
Let us point out that an algorithm for sentence splitting which splits the text in the place of full stops, exclamation marks and question marks is not sufficient.
Dot sign is frequently used in abbreviations, enumerations and other parts of text.Text aligning - yet another auxiliary technique, used amon others to prepare translation memories.
Aligning is done on two texts in different languages, which are each others' translations.
Its goal is to align the sentences of both texts in such a way that aligned sentences are each others' translations.
This operation is necessary because in practice a translation of a text almost never contains the same number of sentences as the original.
During aligning it is not uncommon to have two or more sentences in one language aligned to only one sentence in the other languages.
There are numerous text align algorithms.
Regarding the nature of the problem, they are all quite complex.Software engineering - apart from computational linguistics I am quite interested in software engineering, which put simply is knowledge of how to create good software.
This knowledge is very useful for me from practical point of view, I apply it whenever I design a new piece of software or develop existing.© 2018 Rafał Jaworski | rjawor at amu.edu.pl | XHTML 1.1 | CSS | design by dcarterRafał Jaworski: HomeUniversity home page | Faculty home page |  | RAFAŁ JAWORSKI - HOME PAGEMAIN PAGETEACHINGSCIENCERELAXCONTACTlatest news01.09.2015An interactive demo of the Concordia system was released.
