I would be glad to start scientific projects or help anyone interested in the following subjects:\n\t\t\t\t\nApproximate searching\nExample-based translation\nCorpora acquisition\nSentence splitting\nText aligning\nSoftware engineering\nApproximate searching - my main field of interest. Its task is to find in the text not necessarily exact matches of input pattern. The technique is applied whenever the searched resource might contain errors (e.g. OCR corpora).\n\t\t\t\t\nExample Based Machine Translation - my former main field of interest, subject of my Master's Thesis. EBMT is translation based on analogy principle. Its idea can be explained as follows:\nLet the language from\nAn example is a pair of sentences (in source and target language respectively) where the target sentence is a good translation of the source sentence. A large set of examples is called a translation memory. EBMT of the input sentence is done by the following steps:\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFind an example in the translation memory whose source sentence is most similar to the input sentence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tModify the example, so that its source sentence maximally resembles the input sentence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReturn the modified target sentence as translation result.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAs you can see, some of the above steps are non-trivial. What does it mean that to sentences are "similar", how to acquire translation memory and, most importantly, how to modify the example. All of these problems are parts of EBMT.\n\t\t\t\t\nParallel text corpora acquisition - auxiliary technique, acquired corpora can serve as translation memories for EBMT and for many other purposes (e.g. statistical translation). However, corpora acquisition is a very interesting task itself. It consists in developing tools for automatic text extraction from documents acquired from the Internet or from any other source.\n\t\t\t\t\nSentence splitting - or "Sensplitting". Another auxiliary technique which, contrary to what you might think, is not trivial. Let us point out that an algorithm for sentence splitting which splits the text in the place of full stops, exclamation marks and question marks is not sufficient. Dot sign is frequently used in abbreviations, enumerations and other parts of text.\n\t\t\t\t\nText aligning - yet another auxiliary technique, used amon others to prepare translation memories. Aligning is done on two texts in different languages, which are each others' translations. Its goal is to align the sentences of both texts in such a way that aligned sentences are each others' translations. This operation is necessary because in practice a translation of a text almost never contains the same number of sentences as the original. During aligning it is not uncommon to have two or more sentences in one language aligned to only one sentence in the other languages. There are numerous text align algorithms. Regarding the nature of the problem, they are all quite complex.\n\t\t\t\t\nSoftware engineering - apart from computational linguistics I am quite interested in software engineering, which put simply is knowledge of how to create good software. This knowledge is very useful for me from practical point of view, I apply it whenever I design a new piece of software or develop existing.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t© 2018 Rafał Jaworski | rjawor at amu.edu.pl | XHTML 1.1 | CSS | design by dcarter\nRafał Jaworski: Home\nUniversity home page | Faculty home page |  | \nRAFAŁ JAWORSKI - HOME PAGE\nMAIN PAGE\nTEACHING\nSCIENCE\nRELAX\nCONTACT\nlatest news\n01.09.2015\nAn interactive demo of the Concordia system was released.
